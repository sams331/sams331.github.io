    <h2>Greetings!</h2>
    <p>My name is Samuel B., but I go for sams331. I'm currently learning web development, node.js (specifically discord bots), and OS. This site is my personal website, not just a profile.</p>
    <p>I was interested in tech since I was a little kid. When I learned about computers and its features when I was little, I was interested. When I grew up a little, I tested the waters of coding. After that, I dove through the world of coding. I was creating A LOT of things.</p>
    <p>But you know, in life, not everything is about your hobby. You have other things to do in this life, such as school. When I entered junior high school, eveything just slows down. I'm slowing down coding, and I just didn't code that intense.</p>
    <p>I created this page to feel again. Remember again when I first learned coding. The feeling was unreal. It was like i unlocked a different side of this word.</p>
    <p>Later in life, I want these things that I learned to be useful not just for me but to other people. I wanna use it to help people. Make things convenient for people. You and I only live once, and I wanna make it impactful.</p>
    <p>See ya!</p>
